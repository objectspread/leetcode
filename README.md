# Project Title

**Description**:  Put a meaningful, short, plain-language description of what
this project is trying to accomplish and why it matters.
Describe the problem(s) this project solves.

The goal of this project is to provide an open discussion space and a contribution track on attempts to DSA questions

These problems would be from variant sources, majorly Leetcode, Hackerrank and 

Other things to include:

  - **Status**:  Active
  - While other projects focus on the right solutions to algorithmic problems, this project provides alternative ways of solving these problems.
